# Project00
Project00 A photographic (and typographic) representation of a community that’s under-represented or falsely-represented in the realm of the web I often think of myself as a privileged artist and technologist, who’s in possession of certain powers, economical and technological. I want to use my power to represent the under-represented, and the falsely-represented. Represent the people that you choose using HTML and CSS. Let the coding commence. Build a single page on either codepen.io, jsbin.com, or jsfiddle.net You can also use GitHub to host this page. Check out GitHub Pages to learn how.
